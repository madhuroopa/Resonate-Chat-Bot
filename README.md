# Resonate: A Retrieval Augmented Framework For Meeting Insight Extraction
In the fast-paced professional realm, meetings serve as vital platforms for collaboration and decision-making. Yet, among the vast exchange of information, recollecting essential details often proves challenging, hindering overall productivity. Imagine a scenario where past discussions on User Interface design are essential but cumbersome to retrieve.

Our project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a solution to effortlessly extract pivotal insights from historical meetings. expeeLeveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques, our proposed system enables users to seamlessly upload meeting records and pose queries for relevant information retrieval. One core component of the system is to group meetings based on their abstractive summaries. Several state-of-the-art clustering algorithms were extensively trained and evaluated. When users pose inquiries, our system will pinpoint the cluster most likely to contain relevant discussions. 

By utilizing the Pinecone vector store database, we retrieve pertinent conversations within a contextual window. The retrieved conversations and custom prompt are then processed through a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate precise responses. Our focus on system optimization involves exploring diverse encoders and LLM models, with fine-tuning to ensure rigorous evaluation and seamless integration. Through our approach, we transcend challenges in conversational meeting summarization, content discovery, and delivering a tailored, high-performance solution designed for user convenience. 

## Objectives
- User should be able to upload an audio/video meeting file along with a meeting `Topic`
- There can be multiple meeting topics. With each topic having a series of meetings.
- Use would then be able to choose a `topic` and chat with the meeting just and ask any question

## Initial Sketches

RAG Inference
- The user would select the meeting `Topic` and ask a question.
- Pinecone would retrieve relevant information and would feed the LLm with custom prompt, context, and the user query.
- We also plan to add a `Semantic Router` to route queries according to the user input.
- The LLm would then generate the result and answer the question.

Data Store
- The below diagram shows how we plan to store data using `Pinecone` which is a popular Vector DB.
- User would upload meetings in audio/video format.
- We would use `AWS Transcribe` to diarize and transcribe the audio file into `timestamp, speaker, text` (this is simplified)
- We would embed the text data into vectors that would be uploaded to Pinecone serverless.

Research
- We would try multiple `Vector embeddings` and also fine-tune `LLM Models`  on the custom dataset and compare the performance of these models.

## Getting Started

### Running on Github Codespace

1. Create a Codespace with 4 cores.
2. Press Ctrl+C to cancel the automatic installation of requirements.txt, as it may not install the packages correctly.
3. Manually install required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Setting environment variables
    - Create a `/config/.env` file and fill in your environment variables.
    - Learn more about config options: README

5. Running the pre-requisits script:

    ```bash
    python init_one_time_utils/pinecone_sample_dataloader.py
    ```

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartajBhuvaji/Resonate.git
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```powershell
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    ```

5. Setting environment variables:

    Create a `/config/.env` file and fill in your environment variables.

6. Running the pre-requisite script:

    ```bash
    python init_one_time_utils/pinecone_sample_dataloader.py
    ```

7. Run the application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
